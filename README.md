# Vintage Knack-Bass Plugin

The intended purpose of this plugin is to create the percussive _click_ or _knack_ sound as played by [Ladi Geisler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladi_Geisler) and many other bassists. This is achieved by temporarily boosting the high frequencies of the input signal when a note is being played.
